# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, suggest breaking into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones.

## Task Right-Sizing

A task is the smallest unit that carries its own test cycle and is worth a fresh reviewer's gate. Each task ends with an independently testable deliverable.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Use subagent-driven-development (recommended) or executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

**Spec:** [path to the spec/design doc this plan implements]

## Global Constraints

[The spec's project-wide requirements — one line each, with exact values.]

```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: [what this task uses from earlier tasks]
- Produces: [what later tasks rely on]

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code)
- Steps without code blocks for code steps

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan:

**1. Spec coverage:** Every requirement has a task?
**2. Placeholder scan:** Any red flags from "No Placeholders"?
**3. Type consistency:** Do names match across tasks?

Fix issues inline. If a spec requirement has no task, add the task.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer execution choice:

**"Plan saved to `docs/superpowers/plans/<filename>.md`. Two options:**

**1. Subagent-Driven (recommended)** - Fresh subagent per task, review between tasks
**2. Inline Execution** - Batch execution with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**
